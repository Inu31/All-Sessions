        <p>Plants are one of six big groups (kingdoms) of living things. They are autotrophic eukaryotes, which means they have complex cells, and make their own food. Usually they cannot move (not counting growth). Plants include familiar types such as trees, herbs, bushes, grasses, vines, ferns, mosses, and green algae.</p>
